# README Generator 

## Description

Read Me Generator that generates a readme when prompted by "node index.js". This application requires node.js in order to run properly. 

## Versions 

- "initial commit" 
- "code is working" - worked with tutor to the ReadMe to generate
- "filled out readme questions" -added readme questions
- "updated readme output" - updated the readme questions
- "updated the code to run the licenses including the images and the links"
- "added prompt and reformmated slightly"
- "added notes, video, updated ReadMe" - I didn't quite make the ReadMe match the git generated read me. I hope that is okay. I can go back and update this ReadMe fairly easily to match that one.

In the video, I pretyped the answers for the ReadMe elsewhere in order to expediate typing out the test.
